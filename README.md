This repository demonstrates a common VHDL coding error leading to unintended latches. The `buggy_code.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code, while `fixed_code.vhdl` provides the corrected version.  The issue stems from an incomplete sensitivity list in a VHDL process. This can lead to unexpected behavior and synthesis issues. The corrected code ensures correct functionality and avoids the unintended latch.
